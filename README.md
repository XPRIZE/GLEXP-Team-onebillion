###### One app for reading, writing and numeracy. By non-profit onebillion.



## Our onecourse submission 
Our onecourse submission for Global Learning XPRIZE consists of four elements:

### 1. onecourse demo for XPRIZE judges
[![onecourse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Filesytem%20Images-â¬‡%20Download%20onecourse%20Demo-37bc37.svg)](https://github.com/XPRIZE/GLEXP-Team-onebillion/releases/download/v1.1.0/onecourse-demo-v1.0.0.tar.gz "onecourse demo")

[Installation instructions for onecourse demo](INSTALL.md)

This is for you, and not for children. It contains:

- over 50 sample units from the course, for reading, writing and numeracy, in both Swahili and English 
- a video showing how the childâ€™s daily access will be structured, when the course is complete 
- video clips of children using the material, filmed in Tanzania, the UK, Malawi, and Uganda. 

The two language buttons allow you switch between English and Swahili, for the sample units. 


### 2. onecourse Swahili for children

The handbook contains:

- an overview of onecourse 
- colour-coded sections on Reading, Writing, Numeracy, Design, and Technology, corresponding to tabs in your demo app 
- a summary of evidence from trials and pilot tests which were carried out in several countries, to evaluate the efficacy of onecourse 
- information about onebillion â€“ the non-profit organisation which produced onecourse â€“ and the work we do
- a set of appendices with further details about the course, our research, the software, the schedule to completion, and so on.
