[Installation instructions for onecourse demo](https://github.com/onebillionchildren/XPRIZE-ob-android/INSTALL)

This is for you, and not for children. It contains:

- over 50 sample units from the course, for reading, writing and numeracy, in both Swahili and English 
- a video showing how the childâ€™s daily access will be structured, when the course is complete 
- video clips of children using the material, filmed in Tanzania, the UK, Malawi, and Uganda. 

The two language buttons allow you switch between English and Swahili, for the sample units. 


###2. onecourse Swahili for children

- a summary of evidence from trials and pilot tests which were carried out in several countries, to evaluate the efficacy of onecourse 
- information about onebillion â€“ the non-profit organisation which produced onecourse â€“ and the work we do
- a set of appendices with further details about the course, our research, the software, the schedule to completion, and so on.

##onecourse overview


#### :green_book: onecourse is comprehensive
It is designed to enable children to achieve basic literacy and numeracy in their own language, whether in or out of school. 


#### :raising_hand: onecourse is child-friendly and engaging
A little teacher figure guides the child through our wide range of learning activities, with their clean and simple graphic style.


#### :package: onecourse is modular in structure
This makes it easy to personalize, add further content, and scale to other languages. Our numeracy content is already in use around the world, in 50 languages. Our literacy content is in English, Swahili, and Chichewa.


#### :busts_in_silhouette: onecourse is born of experience
We have a wealth of experience in delivering education through software, over many years. The data and observations we collect have fed into the course design.


#### :earth_africa: onecourse is inspired by our vision
Our goal is to empower one billion marginalised children around the world, through education. We work with partners to help us achieve this goal.


#### :chart_with_upwards_trend: onecourse has evidence of impact
Our numeracy material has been evaluated by Lamar University (Texas), University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), University of Nottingham (UK), and University of Malawi. Formal trials showed significant positive results. Our reading material had a short trial in Dar es Salaam, with promising results, and is now part of a larger, longer trial in Malawi.


#### :open_hands: onecourse is for sharing
Our learning activities can easily be added to other developersâ€™ solutions, if we are an XPRIZE finalist. We will add the best of other finalistsâ€™ solutions to onecourse, to help ensure the best possible outcome for the child. 


#### :pencil2: onecourse will soon be complete
It is now is around 70% complete. Most of the remaining material will be released by August 2017, with the remainder early in 2018. We plan 3000 learning units in total.
