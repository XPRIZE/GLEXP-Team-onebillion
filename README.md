###### One app for reading, writing and numeracy. By non-profit onebillion.



## Our onecourse submission 
Our onecourse submission for Global Learning XPRIZE consists of three elements:

### 1. onecourse Swahili for children
[![onecourse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Filesytem%20Images-â¬‡%20Download%20onecourse%20Swahili-ffce00.svg)](https://github.com/XPRIZE/GLEXP-Team-onebillion/releases/tag/v1.5.0 "onecourse swahili")

[Installation instructions for onecourse Swahili](INSTALL.md)

Here you can experience the onecourse material as children in Tanzania would experience it.  

### 2. onecourse English for children

Our onecourse English entry is on our github repository, but not on a tablet. It has been verified by the XPRIZE team. 

### 3. onecourse handbook
[![onecourse](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-ðŸ“–%20View%20onecourse%20Handbook-0092ff.svg)](onecourse_handbook.pdf "onecourse demo")

The handbook contains:

- an overview of onecourse 
- colour-coded sections on Reading, Writing, Numeracy, Design, and Technology, corresponding to tabs in your demo app 
- a summary of evidence from trials and pilot tests which were carried out in several countries, to evaluate the efficacy of onecourse 
- information about onebillion â€“ the non-profit organisation which produced onecourse â€“ and the work we do
- a set of appendices with further details about the course, our research, the software, the schedule to completion, and so on.
